# 1: Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

PDB Statistics

**Overview of the data**

```{r}
data <- read.csv("Data_Export_Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

**X-ray 87.53% and EM 4.95%**

```{r}
round((sum(data$"X.ray") / sum(data$"Total")) * 100, 2)
round((sum(data$"EM") / sum(data$"Total")) * 100, 2)
```

**For every column:**

```{r}
round((colSums(data) / sum(data$Total)) * 100, 2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

**87.4%**

```{r}
# To extract the column and select that value in the row:
data$Total[1]
```

```{r}
round((data$Total[1] / sum(data$Total)) * 100, 2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

**23409**

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

**We don't see the hydrogen atoms, only the oxygen one, because the resolution is 1.9 Armstrong**

> Q5: There is a conserved water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

**HOH308:0**

# 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

**Using Bio3D in R for structure bioinformatics**

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hel")
pdb
```
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
# Normal mode analysis (nma)
# Do a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA): a prediction of the conformational variability and intrinsic dynamics of this protein.
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
# Make a little movie (trajectory) for viewing in VMD
mktrj(m, file="nma.pdb")
```
